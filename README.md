# üé• YouTube Engagement Automation

This project is a **YouTube engagement automation tool** designed to:
1. **Fetch transcripts** of a given YouTube video.
2. **Analyze transcripts** to find interesting snippets (especially for horror/emotional content).
3. **Generate context-aware comments** using a Hugging Face LLM (e.g., `microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct`).
4. **Simulate watch behavior** with random pauses, scrolling, liking, and commenting using **Playwright**.
5. **Avoid duplicate comments** by maintaining a history of posted comments.

## **‚öôÔ∏è Features**
- Extract video **ID and title** from a YouTube URL.
- Fetch and rank transcript snippets using **YouTubeTranscriptApi**.
- Generate a **natural, human-like comment** with an LLM pipeline.
- Use **Playwright** to:
  - Simulate watching the video (3‚Äì10 min).
  - Like the video.
  - Post a generated comment.
- Avoid posting duplicate comments using a `used_comments.json` file.

## **üì¶ Requirements**

### **Python Libraries**
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Playwright Setup**
```bash

playwright install-deps
```

## **üîë Configuration**
The main config values are defined at the top of the script:
- `HUGGINGFACE_MODEL` ‚Äì Hugging Face model to use for comment generation.
- `WATCH_TIME_MIN`, `WATCH_TIME_MAX` ‚Äì Randomized watch duration (in seconds).
- `COMMENT_HISTORY_FILE` ‚Äì Path to the JSON file storing posted comments.

To **simulate logged-in behavior**, ensure your **YouTube cookies** are saved as:
```bash
youtube_cookies.json
```
You can export cookies using browser extensions like **EditThisCookie** or **Get cookies.txt**.

## **üß† How It Works**
1. **Extract Video Info:**  
   `get_video_id()` and `get_video_title()` fetch the video ID and title.

2. **Fetch Transcript:**  
   `get_transcript_snippets()` pulls transcript lines (Hindi/English) and ranks them by "interestingness" using horror/emotional keywords.

3. **Generate Comments:**  
   `generate_comment()` crafts a context-aware comment using the transcript and video title.

4. **Prevent Duplicates:**  
   `save_comment()` ensures new comments are unique.

5. **Simulate Watch + Engagement:**  
   `watch_and_comment()` opens Chrome (via Playwright), simulates watching, likes the video, and posts the comment.
